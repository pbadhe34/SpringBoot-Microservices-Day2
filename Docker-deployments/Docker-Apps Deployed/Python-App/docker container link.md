 


Container linking 
Better option is to use docker-compose


To get the redis working  

docker run -d --name redis-container -h redis-host redis

Link the redis container to py-app container whle starting

docker run -it -d -p 3000:8090 --link redis-container:redis --name py-client  test-app:v1

 The value provided to the link flag is sourcecontainername:containeraliasname. The value redis-container  in the sourcecontainername since that was the name that was given to our first container that launched earlier. The containeraliasname has been selected as redis and it could be any name of choice.
