Open Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager
Select the VM used by Docker
Click Settings -> Network
Adapter 1 should (default?) be "Attached to: NAT"
Click Advanced -> Port Forwarding
Add rule: Protocol TCP, Host Port 8080, Guest Port 8080 (leave Host IP and Guest IP empty)
Guest is your docker container and Host is your machine
You should now be able to browse to your container via localhost:8080 and your-internal-ip:8080.
